# hello-world
I should write a bit about myself: well, at the moment I am super-busy trying to get four different courses under way. Part of the material I have taught, but quite a bit is either new, or needs overhauling, so I'll be exceedingly busy over Christmas. At the same time, the weather is great, so I'm enjoying that! Over and out!
